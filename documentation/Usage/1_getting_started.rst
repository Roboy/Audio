Getting started
===============

How does it work?
-----------------

You can roslaunch or rosrun every node that is currently released. But you will need a sound source from which the algorithms can get needed data.
For that you can either use a Matrix Creator and run the rosnodes on it or try to change the rostopic names inside of the code and use it for your own sources.


How to extend it?
-----------------

You can create new rosnodes, by adding new catkin packages to the root folder (roboy_audio). You can find a Tutorial for creating catkin packages on the ROS Tutorial side (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage).
