Installation
=============

We use catkin to build our tools. So make sure that you have a working catkin workspace.

Using command line
------------------

Clone the audio repository into the source folder of your catkin workspace.
``git clone https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_audio /path/to/catkin_workspace/src/roboy_audio``

Navigate to your catkin workspace.
``cd /path/to/catkin_workspace`

Make everything with the catkin make command.
``catkin_make``

Have fun with roslaunch.
``roslaunch <package-name> <launch-file>``


Using IDE (Clion)
----------------------------------

Clone the audio repository.
``git clone https://github.com/Roboy/roboy_audio``

Now open the CMakeLists.txt from the package that you want to edit.
